Earthquake is a natural disaster. Earthquakes are usually caused when underground rocks suddenly breaks along a fault. 
This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake.During the earthquake and afterward, 
the plates or blocks of rock start moving, and they continue to move until they get stuck again. The spot underground 
where the rock breaks is called the focus of the earthquake. The place right above the focus (on top of the ground) is 
called the epicenter of the earthquake.

The main focus of our project is to collect the tectonic plate movement data and compare it to the existing data from 
NASA. We are using an accelerometer to measure the ground movement in x, y, z, axis. This will be place in different 
area. When any movement occurs that will be recorded and send to an online data server . The app will keep a record. 
Also, by using machine learning to predict earthquake on a particular area . Like after collecting 3 months of data 
we can observe the situation of the tectonic plate and compare it to past 5 years data from NASA. This will give a 
clear prediction of any earthquake near future. The prediction will be more accurate as the machine learning algorithm 
continues to find the best possible outcomes. This will let people to take early precaution for any upcoming disaster 
related to earthquake. In the future we will be developing this project to use not only for our earth but also far 
beyond other planets as we are already planning to build habitation on mars to ensure human safety. This project is cost 
effective too. "A $10 solution to save many lives".
